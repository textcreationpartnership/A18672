            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>As we haue heard ſo haue wee ſeene in the Citie of the Lord of Hostes, in the Citie of our God, God will ſtabliſh it for euer.</hi>

                  <hi>God ſhall helpe it verie early. Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is he whome thou chooſest and cauſeſt to come to thee, he ſhall dwell in thy courts, and wee ſhall be ſatisfied with the pleaſures of thine houſe, euen of thine holie Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi>

               <p>The third reaſon which ought great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to recommend faith vnto vs, is that, as we cannot be agreeable to God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, as we haue ſhewed; <note place="margin">Rom. 14.</note> alſo nothing of all that proceeds from vs, can be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing vnto him without it, neither pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There were in old time ſome Philoſophers and Law-makers, who although they were jnfidels, they ſeemed nevertheles to be adorned with many laudable vertues; as <hi>Socrates, Licurgus, Epaminondas, Aristides, Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,</hi> both the <hi>Catoes,</hi> and diuers others, and nevertheleſſe all that which ſeemed reſplendant in them, was but a maske and falſe viſard of vertue. For even as a flower painted vpon a wall, hath the forme and colour of a flower, but not the life, the beauty, and the ſweetneſſe; Like alſo as a fire painted on a board
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:19488:10"/> hath the forme therof, but not the light nor the heat; alſo all the vertues that were in theſe great jlluſtrious perſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, were all but ſhadows and ſhews of vertue.

And ſuch perſonages ſayth S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble a liuely horſe, that trots well and vſeth his joynts nimbly, but is out of his way; for the more he goeth forward, the more hee looſeth himſelfe; So ſuch people being not in the way which God hath appoyn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:19488:10" rendition="simple:additions"/> Faith) were reputed for ſinnes before God, grounding his ſpeech vppon that which the Apoſtle writeth to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans. All that is done without Faith, <note place="margin">Rom. 14.</note> is ſinne. To the end then that wee, our workes, and our vertues may be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to God, true Faith is neceſſary for vs.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. ¶ A diuiſion of the kinds of Faith, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of mention is made in the Scripture.</head>
               <p>THis word of Faith in the ſcripture is not alwaies to bee taken in one ſence, nor in one ſignification; which muſt bee noted, to the end that thoſe that read the woord of God bee not deceaved by the antiquity and equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this word, the which is found to be alledged in ſix ſundry ſorts, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of fiue are vaine, and the laſt onely is true. Now the firſt kind is the Faith which ſome men call hiſtoricall, the which is nothing elſe but the ſimple knowledge of the things ſpoken of in
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:19488:11"/> the Scriptures, as well of the old as of the new Teſtament. The which know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge onely is not ſufficient to make a man faithfull, for we ſee that the <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines</hi> among the Iewes haue great knowledge in texts of the Scripture, and ſome true jntelligence of many places thereof, the which nevertheleſſe are not reputed faithfull for all that. In the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtry likewiſe wee ſee many Monckes and Doctors of <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> and of other Vniverſities, that can well alleadge and compare divers places of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in their ſermons and writings, the which moſt an end they pull (as it is ſayd) by the haires, to make them to ſerue for proofe and confirmation of their errours and lyes. Nevertheles they are ſo farre from being faithfull, that there are no people more contrary nor more enemies to the true Faith of Ieſus Chriſt, nor that do reſiſt and fight with greater furie and courage againſt the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelicall verity, then they. It is not then jnough to read the holy Scriptures, to remember that which is therein ſpoken of, for to ground a firme Faith,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:19488:11" rendition="simple:additions"/> by the which we may be juſtified in the judgement of God, and be agreeable vnto him.</p>
               <p>The ſecond kind is of thoſe that haue a faith like vnto that of Divels; <note place="margin">Iames. 2.</note> who by reaſon of the ſubtilty of their ſpirits, and of the long time ſince their creation, are not jgnorant of the holy ſcriptures, which we ſee in the hiſtory of the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, which ſay, that Satan addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing himſelfe to Ieſus Chriſt, <note place="margin">Mat. 4.</note> to trye if he could make him turne, and to ſnatch from him the faith and perſwaſion that he had, that he was the ſonne of God; alleadgeth places of ſcripture vnto him, to wit, of the 91. Pſalme, wherein hee ſhewed that hee had ſome knowledge thereof; but hee was not faithfull though, being deſtitute of the feare of God, of the hope of Salvation, and of a true confidence in his promiſes. All which things are neceſſarily and eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of the nature of true faith. So that if theſe things are not joyned vnto it; it cannot in any wiſe ſubſiſt. Wee ſee alſo that many heretickes, as <hi>Arius, Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donius, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>alentine, Marcion, Apollina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:19488:12"/> Neſtorius, Eutiches,</hi> and divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, had the Scriptures in hand, which they did pervert and corrupt, being jnduced therevnto by the evill ſpirit, who vrged them, and made them obſtinate, the which although they were in the Church, marked with the Baptiſme of Ieſus Chriſt, exerciſed in the texts of the Bible it ſelfe, provided with Eccleſiaſticall charge. Nevertheles let not to be wicked and vnbeleevers, as alſo the Apoſtle calleth them Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, and ſtraglers from the faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1. Tim. 1.</note> This ſecond kind may ſeeme to ſome to be like vnto the former; but there is great difference betweene thoſe two, the which may clearely be perceived by the collation of their effects, for hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call faith doth not rejoyce, trouble, nor aſſure the conſciences of thoſe that haue it, the which reading the hiſtories &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther texts of the Bible, are no more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in their hearts with the reading ther of, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if they read ſome profane hiſtory, or other treatiſe of Philoſophy, becauſe they did not apply the reading thereof to the end &amp; true vſe, whereto it ought
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:19488:12" rendition="simple:additions"/> to be applyed, which is to rule and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine the eſtate of the affections, paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, deſires, and all humane actions, but doe content themſelues that they haue well remembred what they haue read, to ſet it before them as occaſion is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, in ſuch company as they ſhall be in, and ſhew thereby that they are not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of Theologie; but the faith of Divels and the reprobate repreſents vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, the threatnings, judgments, and dreadfull face of God, which doth ſometimes ſo aſtoniſh and fright them, that they tremble and quake, ſeeking every where for reſt and remedie to their torment, which they cannot find, ſo that of ſome them that cannot vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe it, ſincke vnder the burthen, and fall into deſpaire, as we may ſee by the examples of <hi>Caine, Sem,</hi> and <hi>Iudas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third is the faith of Myracles, whereof mention is made in S. <hi>Mathew,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 7.</note> where it is ſayd, that many ſhall ſay vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Ieſvs Chriſt at the day of judgement, Lord, Lord, haue wee not propheſied through thy name, and through thy name haue caſt out Divels, and done
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:19488:13"/> many great worker through thy name, and then I will confeſſe openly vnto them, depart from me yee that that worke jniquity. By the which woords Ieſus Chriſt rejecteth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver haue done had they been provided with a true faith, with the which it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to diſpleaſe God; It is alſo ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in the firſt Epiſtle to the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, <note place="margin">1. Cor. 13. Iohn. 1. 1. Cor. 5. Ephe. 2.</note> where the Apoſtle ſpeaketh in this manner, <hi>If I haue all faith, ſo that I can remooue Mountaines, and haue not charitie, I am nothing.</hi> Which he would not ſay of a true faith, the which maketh a man the child of God, and a member of the body of Ieſus Chriſt, and Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of heavenly Cittie; It is alſo ſpoken of in the 2. Epiſtle to the Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonians, <note place="margin">2. Theſ. 2.</note> where the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Then ſhall the wicked bee reuealed whome the Lord ſhall conſume with the spirit of his mouth, and ſhall destroye with the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his comming: Euen him whoſe comming is after the working of Satan, in all power and ſignes and woonders of lying, and in all deceauablenes of vnrighteouſnes, in them that periſh, becauſe they receaued</hi>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:19488:13" rendition="simple:additions"/> not the loue of the truth, that they might be ſaued, which ſheweth jnough that faith and the facultie to doe mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, is not alwayes jnoyned with the Spirit of regeneration and ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for <hi>Iudas</hi> who was of the nomber of the Apoſtles, had that power to doe miracles, although that Ieſus Chriſt ſaith of him that he was a Divell.</p>
               <p>The fourth kind of Fith, whereof is ſpoken in the Scripture is a Temporall faith, wherewith thoſe men were proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for a while, of whome mention is made in <hi>St. Luke,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 8.</note> where it is ſpoken of thoſe, vpon whom the ſeed fell, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaved it for a time euen with joye, but hauing not taken roote in their hearts, withdrew themſelues in time of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. <hi>Simon</hi> the Sorcerer was of this number, of whome it is ſpoken in the Acts, <hi>That he beleeued and was baptized;</hi>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Iames. 2.</note> The fift kind of Faith, is that which is called dead by S. <hi>Iames,</hi> by reaſon of the likeneſſe it hath to a dead body, for as after the ſeparation of the ſoule, the body which remaineth being dead, hath neither mooving nor feeling; alſo a dead faith hath no feeling of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits and graces of God, to poyſe and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme them according to their value, wherein they are like vnto Hogs, that eat vp the Maſt which falleth from the Oake, and neuer looke vp, whence it commeth. Thoſe people are prophane who thinke neither on God, nor Ieſus Chriſt, nor vpon his word, nor vpon his Sacraments, the which hee hath orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in his Church, for the exerciſing,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:19488:14"/> nouriſhing, and jncreaſing of the faith of his children, deſpiſe publike exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, prayers, thanksgivings, and confeſſions. Breefe they ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in all their behaviours to bee Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertines, and diſordinate, never having before their eyes, nor in their memory the great debt which they owe vnto God; for ſo many graces and favours by them receaved, and which they daily receaue at his hands, and as they are without feeling of the aboue-ſaid things ſo are they vnprovided of all good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. For there is no man amongſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that jmployeth him ſelfe to doe well, nor confirme himſelfe to the will of God, but are rather contemners of all the admonitions and advertiſments which are given them; people altogether gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the world, ſlaues to their fleſh, and to the luſts therof, who neither ſerue God, nor make ſhew of it.

               <p>BEfore we enter into the diffinition of the true Faith, which juſtifieth him that hath it, we muſt take our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject a little higher, and declare what is the office and dutie of a chriſtian man; which is to know what hee ought to wayt for from God, and what God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth of him. That which the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full wayt for from God, is their ſalvatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; everlaſting life. That God which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth of him, is a truſt in his goodnes, a feare of his Majeſtie, and an obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his will. The which three things are taught him by the word of God, the which being divided into three parts, that is to ſay, the promiſes, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, and the threatnings; by the promiſes, it teacheth the Chriſtian man to truſt in God, and vppon him to ſet all his hope, and to wayt from him all comfort, ayde, and bleſſing in all his
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:19488:15"/> affayres and neceſſities; and by the commandements teacheth him, what obedience he ought to render to God, and the readineſſe and great care which he ought to ſhew therein; and by the threatnings, the feare which he ſhould haue to offend him, and to doe or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any thing that may diſpleaſe him. Now Faith ſets before it ſelfe theſe three kinds of words. And even as the object of the ſight is the colour, and the ſound is the object to the hearing, alſo the object of Faith is the word of God, the which it looketh vppon continually, ayming at it as at a marke, and thereto bending her whole ſight, and her jnten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from the which word ſhee can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo little ſtray, but ſhee muſt looſe her ſelfe, becauſe that to bee ſure, ſhee muſt of neceſſity reſt vpon a word that is certaine, and ſuch a one as is the only word of God. Therefore is it that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt folkes doe with good right con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the faith of Papiſts, who depend altogether of the Pope, and beleeue jn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently all that hee ſayth vnto them and all that he teacheth them. Becauſe
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:19488:16"/> that beeing a lying and variable man, filled with jgnorance, as are others, it cannot be but his word and his doctrine muſt bee doubtfull and ſubject to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranties. But the Chriſtian Faith which is aſſayled in ſo many ſorts, and which hath ſo many aſſaults to withſtand, and ſo many deviſes to prevent, hath great need to bee vpheld by a word that is firme, and which cannot bee eaſily ſhooke with all the temptations where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it is aſſayled.

               <p>We ſay firſt, that Faith is a certaine knowledge of the word of God, <note place="margin">Pſal. 102. Rom. 3. 2. Cor. 1. Pſal. 100.

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:19488:18"/> and in their vnderſtandings. Whereof wee ſee a good example in <hi>Dauid,</hi> who ſpeaking of the Law and word of God, ſayd thus; <note place="margin">Pſal. 119.</note> 
                  <hi>Thy teſtimonies haue I ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken as an heritage for euer: for they are the ioye of mine heart.

It followeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the Elect, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Expreſſe mention is made of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect in the definition, becauſe it is onely they and no other that are capable of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:19488:18"/> Faith, as it is written in the firſt chapter which the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> writ to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple <hi>Titus,</hi> where it is ſayd. <hi>Paul the ſeruant of God, and an Apoſtle of Ieſus Chriſt, according to the faith of the Elect of God, and the knowledge of the turth which is according to godlyneſſe.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it appeares that Faith doth onely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine to thoſe that from all eternity haue been elected and choſen of God, and ſince by him ſeparated from the world, to be brought vnto the Church, and by degrees to attaine to the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of glory and everlaſting life, the which God from the beginning hath promiſed and prepared for his children. The which may alſo appeare by that which is written in the Acts of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, where it is ſayd, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving preached in <hi>Antioch</hi> of <hi>Piſidie,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Act. 13.3.</note> thoſe that were predeſtinate to eternall life, did beleeue the word of the Lord, which he had ſpoken vnto them. For to ſhew that in this great multitude of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that were come thither, and had aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled themſelues to heare: there were but the Elect onely that receaued
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:19488:19"/> the word by him pronounced, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited thereby. Ieſus Chriſt alſo when he ſayd, that <hi>his ſheepe heare his voyce, and that all that his Father hath giuen him,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Iohn. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>come vnto him;</hi> ſheweth thereby, that thoſe onely heare and beleeue the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, who haue beene predeſtinated, and ſince created and called to this end. S. <hi>Iohn</hi> alſo in his Catholicke chapter 4. confirmes it ſaying <hi>That thoſe onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue the word of God that are of God,</hi> that is to ſay, whome he hath ordayned and deſtinate to that end. When alſo Ieſus Chriſt ſpeaking to <hi>Pylate</hi> of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, of the which he was examined, ſayd, <hi>That his kingdome was not of this world,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Iohn. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>and that all that were of the truth were his, and heard his voyce,</hi> giveth ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently to vnderſtand therby, that vnto all grace is not jndifferently given to yeeld themſelues docible and attentiue to heare, beleeue and follow the truth, but onely to thoſe that God the Father hath diſpoſed therevnto; and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for the which Ieſus Chriſt ſaid, <hi>That he was come into the world not to be ſerued,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>but to ſerue, and to deliuer vp his life to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:19488:19"/> paye the ranſome of many:</hi> ſheweth that ſufficiently, for when he ſayth many, he ſheweth therby that his death is not for all, which it ſhould be nevertheleſſe, if by Faith every one could apprehend it. <note place="margin">Luk. 1.</note> As much ſayth <hi>Zacharie</hi> thereof in his Canticle, <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord God of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell for he hath viſited and redeemed his people.</hi> Wherevpon is to bee noted that he ſpeaketh ſpecially of his people; that is to ſay, of thoſe whome he hath elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and reſerued to himſelfe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, and not of all in generall. Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering what hath been ſayd, that there are none but the Elect that are capeable of Faith, we muſt not wonder if we ſee ſo many deſpiſers of the word of God, which is the word of life, and Science of Salvation, others that hate and abhorre it as a ſavour of death; others that blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme and perſecute it cruelly with fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and water, and all the cruelleſt and moſt horrible torments that they can jn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent or jmagine. Alſo on the other ſide we muſt not maruaile, if wee ſee the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, after they haue receaued and belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the word of God, the which hath
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:19488:20"/> take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deep roote in them, to be firme &amp; conſtant againſt all temptations, and jnvincible againſt all the ſleights, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and promiſes that can bee made them, to divert and turne them from the Faith, which God by his ſpirit hath jnſpired and continued in their hearts. It followeth in the definition.</p>
               <p>Every one in themſelues, which haue been jnſorted to giue to vnderſtand that every one ought to haue his Faith pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and particular, for to apprehend Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt with all his graces and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, and to enjoye the effect and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of the gratious and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelicall promiſes, as writeth the Prophet. That <hi>the iuſt ſhall liue by his faith,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Abac. 2.</note> that is to ſay, by a Faith not bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed, but which is reſident in him. For even as it is requiſite for every one to haue his particular ſoule to animate and quicken his body, the which cannot liue by the ſoule of an other: Alſo it is requiſite for all men generally, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of them haue particularly a proper Faith jnfuſed in his heart by the grace of God, to quicken it; from
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:19488:20"/> whence it followeth, that thoſe that do not heare, nor meditate, nor conferre any whit of the word of God, to haue the jntelligence thereof, cannot haue Faith; of the which the word Faith is as the ſoule, without the which Faith is dead. And as the fire kindled in a Lamp cannot be long entertained, but it muſt goe out, if care bee not had to powre freſh oyle into it to preſerue it; alſo without the word of God, Faith cannot ſubſiſt, nor be long vnprovided for of this nouriture, but it muſt be in priſon, and become as it were ſluggiſh, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally it muſt dye, and be altogether ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed; for wee ſee it happens or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily to thoſe that are negligent in exerciſing themſelues in the meditation of the word of God, as it doth to the water, the which although it be of cold nature, is nevertheleſſe ſubceptible of the heat when it is ſet neere the fire; but when it is taken from it, firſt it cooleth by little and little, and at length com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to it former coldneſſe, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to it firſt nature, the heat quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, and dyeth all together. It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:19488:21"/> in the definition: That Faith is an jndubitable knowledge of all things contained in the word of God, as well in the old as in the new Teſtament. Which is added to reprooue the errours of the <hi>Manicheans</hi> of <hi>Marcion,</hi> and of other hereticks, which did not receaue nor approue none of the bookes of the Bible, but thoſe onely, which did not ſeeme contrary to their hereſies. Alſo for to reject the errours of the Iewes, who doe not approoue the Bookes of the new Teſtament, and likewiſe of the Libertines, who ſay that men muſt not abide in the earth, which is but for chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and ſuch as bee yet in their rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but that men muſt ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to bee conducted by I know not what fantaſticall ſpirit, the which can bring forth nothing but prodigious rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyngs, and ſuch monſters as thoſe that haue beene ſeene in our time in the citie of <hi>Munſter</hi> in <hi>Weſt-phalia,</hi> and elſwhere, where theſe Organs and Inſtruments of of Satan haue been able to gather diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples together. Now we muſt aboue all things take heed to that, and altogether
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:19488:21"/> approue all the books, in the which the ſpirit of God hath pleaſed to reveale and diſcouer his will, and to eſteeme that there is not any ſuperfluous or vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable word therein; and that there is never a portion (what a one ſoever it be) in the ſcripture, that it is dry or bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, which wee experiment when after we haue prayed to God, wee apply our ſelues attentiuely to meditate therevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon; and that to contemplate the ſecrets and myſteries of God which are therin covered and wrapped vp, wee will vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold them like vnto a Tapiſtry, that wee may ſee therin diſcovered the great ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity and art of the workeman who did make and weaue it. It followeth in the definition that the ſame Faith is joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with a true and perfect truſt of their ſalvation, propounded vnto them in the Evangelicall promiſe, and by the grace of God, which ought diligently to be obſerued in the nature and eſſence of Faith; for it ſufficeth not to beleeue in God, and in Ieſus Chriſt, that wee know them in their workes, to admire and adore them; but this knowledge
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:19488:22"/> which we haue of them, and to depend of them in all our affaires and neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to haue our recourſe vnto them to be ſuccoured and ayded in all dangers. And finally when we haue experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their favour and care, which they haue had to helpe vs, we muſt giue them thankes and glorifie their holy name, which S. <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth vs plainly in the 3. chapter of the Epiſtle to the Epheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, the 12. verſe, where he ſayth, <hi>By which Ieſus Christ wee haue boldneſſe and and entrance in with confidence by Faith vnto him.</hi> Alſo in the Epiſtle to He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews chap. 4. <hi>All the faithfull are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to goe with boldneſſe vnto the throne of grace, that we may obtaine mercy, and find grace to helpe in the time of need.</hi> Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt alſo in S. <hi>Iohn</hi> exhorting the Apoſtle to beleeue in him, <note place="margin">Iohn. 14.</note> and in God his Father, doth not meane to exhort them onely to know the eſſence, or the will of the one or the other, but alſo to put their whole truſt in them. And when in <hi>Eſay</hi> chap. 28. it is ſayd, <hi>That who ſo euer beleeueth in God ſhall neuer bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded.</hi> It ought not to be vnderſtood
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:19488:22"/> only of the knowledge which we ought to haue of the certainty and verity of the doctrine and word pronounced and preached; but alſo of the truſt vnto the which ſuch a knowledge doth conduct vs, to referre our ſelues with all our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres, to God, and to his providence. Which <hi>Dauid</hi> teacheth vs in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as in the 2. Pſalme, where hee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth the Princes and great Lords to do homage to Ieſus Chriſt, ſaying, <hi>Serue the Lord in feare, &amp; reioyce in trembling, Kiſſe the Sonne leaſt he be angry, and yee periſh in the way, when his wrath ſhall ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly burne. Bleſſed are all they that trust in him.</hi> And in the 3. Pſalme at the end thereof, <hi>Saluation belongeth vnto the Lord, and thy bleſſing is vpon thy people.</hi> And in the 5. Pſalme, <hi>And let all them that truſt in thee reioyce and triumph for euer, and couer thou them.</hi> And in the 32 Pſalme, <hi>Many ſorrows ſhall come to the wicked: but he that trusteth in the Lord, mercy ſhall compaſſe him.</hi> And in the 25 Pſalme, <hi>Let me not be confounded. I truſt in thee: but let them be confounded that trangreſſe without cauſe.</hi> And in the 34
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:19488:23"/> Pſalme, <hi>The Lord redeemeth the ſoules of his Seruants: and none that truſt in him ſhall periſh.</hi> Wee may ſee by theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels and jnfinite others which are in the Scripture, that this terme of Faith is not ſimply taken onely for the knowledge of the truth of the word of God; but principally for the truſt, hope, and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance which we have of the effect of the promiſes of God, of his grace and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, of the loue and affection which he beareth vs, and of his care of vs, and of all our affaires to conduct them happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, according as our good and ſalvation requireth. It followeth that this Faith is propounded vnto them in the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall promiſe by the grace of God.</p>
               <p>Wherevpon we muſt note two things; firſt that the ſubject and principal foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, vpon the which Faith is built, is not the Law, nor the commandements which propound nothing elſe but a curſe vpon thoſe that tranſgreſſe them, nor yet the threatnings which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound nothing but the wrath of God to thoſe that withſtand them, which may rather affright and aſtoniſh,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:19488:23"/> then comfort and aſſure, wherefore the faithfull man muſt not haue a regard to the Law, or to threatnings of God, to aſſure himſelfe of his grace, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent of his ſalvation, which depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth thereon; but he muſt keepe his eyes fixed vppon the promiſe of God, which is the ground and the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wherevpon the whole building and edifies of his Faith may reſt, and be well vpheld, which is the cauſe that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſayth in Romaines the 10. <hi>That Faith commeth by hearing, and hearing by the word of God:</hi> to wit the woord of Faith, the which was preached by the Apoſtles. And in the 4. hee ſayth it more expreſly. Therefore <hi>by Faith is the Inheritance giuen, that it might be by grace, that the promiſe might be ſure to all the ſeed, not to that onely which is of the Law, but to that alſo which is the Faith of Abraham, which is the father of vs all.</hi> Theſe two percels evidently ſhew that Faith regards principally the promiſe of the grace, which God offereth in his Sonne Ieſus Chriſt, to all thoſe that ſhal acknowledge him for their Saviour, and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:19488:24"/> Mediatour, and we muſt not ſeeke any other meanes wherevppon to ground the hope of our ſalvation; for there is no other name vnder Heaven by the which wee can bee ſaued. The other poynt that we muſt obſerue, is that, the grace of God, that is to ſay, his good will and affection towards vs, is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cauſe that hath jnduced him, as well to make vs a promiſe of life, as to jmpart the gift of Faith, by the which we em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace him. For that he hath taken out of our hearts the naturall hardneſſe and obſtinacy which was therein, and hath mollyfied them, to the end that being tender and ſoft, they might be capable to receaue their promiſe to bee there printed and jngraven; this proceeds not, nor comes of any thing elſe than of his onely grace and favour, which it hath pleaſed him to doe vs, as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Epiſtle to the Epheſians, <note place="margin">Ephc. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>That Faith is a gift of God:</hi> and in the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the Philippians, <note place="margin">Philip. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>It hath beene gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto you to beleeue,</hi> ſayd the Apoſtle vnto them. Alſo the ſpirit of God is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the ſpirit of Faith, in the 2. Epiſtle
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:19488:24"/> to the Corinthians, <note place="margin">2. Cor. 4.</note> to giue vs to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that he is the onely author of Faith, as hee is of counſell, of feare, of vnderſtanding, of prude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, of wiſdome; all which gifts are attributed vnto him in the ſcripture, as to him who is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly author and cauſe of them; Which may yet appeare in conſidering the two members of Faith: which are the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the word of God, <note place="margin">Cor. 2. Mat. 6. Iohn. 1.</note> which is in the vnderſtanding, and the truſt which is in the heart. For as for the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of it ſelfe, it is but darkneſſe, and is altogether vncapable to vnderſtand the things that are of God, &amp; ſpirituall. And as for the heart, being naturally obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and rebellious, it cannot in any wiſe ſubmit and ſubject it ſelfe to the will of God, to truſt in him and to call vpon him, whereof followeth, <note place="margin">Gen. 6.</note> that man being by nature enclined to jgnorance in his vnderſtanding part, and to rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion and obſtinacy in his heart, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be for theſe reaſons ſuſceptible nor capable of Faith. If God by his ſpirit doth not take away theſe too lets, which are in him by nature, to render him
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:19488:25"/> plyable to heare, and to truſt to that which he promiſeth him. It followeth in the definition, that this faith is ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſatisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made to the juſtice of God, by the death &amp; obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of his Son. Whervpon we muſt note, that the promiſe of grace and ſalvation could not bee accompliſhed towards vs, but that firſt the juſtice of God muſt be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and jntirely ſatisfied. For as God for his glory was willing by his promiſe to lay open vnto vs the riches of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and to demonſtrate it vnto vs by the pitty and compaſſion which he hath had of vs, to the end that hee might therein be glorified; alſo was it his will that his juſtice ſhould be ſatisfied, and that man ſhould be acquitted towards it of that which hee ought. Now the debts are that hee ſhould ſuffer everlaſting death, for diſobaying to the will of God, and that he ſhould yeeld a perfect and jntire obedience to his Majeſtie, wherof he was a creature and a ſervant, which was vnpoſſible vnto him. By meanes whereof the Sonne of God was faine to effect the everlaſting decree of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:19488:25"/> his father, who had determined and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned to ſaue the men which hee had choſen and reſerved amongſt the reſt, to come into the world and take our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture vppon him, and by that meanes make himſelfe mortall, to render a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and entire obedience vnto the will of God, vnto the death, yea the death of the croſſe, the which was joyned with a curſe, wherewith he charged himſelfe to diſcharge vs, and to pay by that meanes that which he ought not; and to render (as ſayth the Prophet) that which he had not taken. <note place="margin">Pſal. 69.</note> In the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence then of Ieſus Chriſt wee ought to conſider, firſt that it was in our name, and for our ſakes, that it was rendered to God, and that this death which hee hath ſuffered was not becauſe hee had deſerued it. <note place="margin">Heb. 7.</note> For (as ſayth the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle) he was jnnocent, jmpoluted, and ſepareted from ſinners, who onely are bound vnto death, becauſe that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of ſin, is death. <note place="margin">Rom. 6.</note> That then which hee hath rendered vnto the juſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, and which hath deliuered him into the hands of them which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:19488:26"/> him, was not for his amiſſe, but for ours, and that of all the elect whoſe pledge and warranty he was. And we muſt note, that this death which Ieſus Chriſt did once ſuffer, as perfect God and perfect man, was of an jnfinite force and vertue, to purge ſinnes which were jnfinite, becauſe they were committed againſt the Majeſty of God, who is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting, jmmence and jnfinite; and alſo that it is ſufficient to acquite all his children of the judgement of God, and of all their ſinnes, without any excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, how great and how many ſo ever they be, &amp; in what time and age ſoever they were committed.</p>
               <p>The other poynt which we muſt note in the obedience of Ieſus Chriſt, is the perfect and jntire obſervation of all the commandements of God his father, in the which he hath not left out one only poynt, but all hath been accompliſhed by him. The which hee hath likewiſe done in the name of the elect, who by reaſon of the naturall corruption and vice rayning in them, were altogether vncapable, whiles they liue in this
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:19488:26"/> world, to obſerue the Law of God, and to render him a perfect juſtice, the which conſiſteth in a perfect loue, which they ought to beare him; but they cannot not knowing him perfectly; by reaſon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lſo of the deſires of the fleſh which are in them, which turne them from louing God and their neighbour perfectly, as they are bound.</p>
               <p>The third poynt or reaſon which is to be conſidered in the perfect obedience of Ieſus Chriſt, is the ordinary remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſinnes, which wee commit every day, the which are covered by his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; in ſuch ſort, that they come not in accompt in his judgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. For even ſo as <hi>Phyloctetes</hi> covered the ſtinckingnes of his lothſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e &amp; infectious vlcers, with the perfumed robes wherewith he clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed himſelfe; alſo the elect being by Faith clothed with the odoriferous ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of Ieſus Chriſt, although they were ſtincking in themſelues, they are never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe a good ſavour vnto God. And even as in the time of the ancient peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, when walking by the horrible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts of <hi>Arabia,</hi> it happened that ſome
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:19488:27"/> one of them were bitten by Serpents, to the end that of the poyſoned byt death ſhould not follow, <note place="margin">Nom. 21.</note> hee lifted vp his eyes to behold the braſen Serpent that was ſet vp in the middle of the field, and by the beholding of it was preſerued from the daunger: <note place="margin">Iohn. 3.</note> ſo wee walking through the deſerts of the world, where happening that our deſires ſting vs with their venome, and giue vs ſome mortall wound to be preſerued from it, the onely remedy is, to lift vp the eyes of our Faith in the contemplation of Ieſus Chriſt, who is rayſed aboue the heavens, and to aske of God his Father in his name, that he would quitte our debts as we quitte our debitours.</p>
               <p>Of this obedience, vertue, and effect thereof is ſpoken in the Epiſtle to the Romaines, chap. 5. verſe 19. As by the diſobedience of one man many haue beene made ſinners, alſo by the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of one many are made righteous. Alſo in the 2. Epiſtle to the Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans chap. 1. God was in Chriſt recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling the world to himſelfe, not jmpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their ſinnes vnto them. Alſo in
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:19488:27"/> the Epiſtle to the Phillipians chapter 2. verſ. 7. He made himſelfe of no reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, taking vpon him the forme of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and made himſelfe in the likeneſſe of men, and found in figure as a man, he humbled himſelfe, made obedient to death, even the death of the croſſe. And in the Epiſtle to the Hebrewes, chap. 6. verſ. 11. Chriſt being become an high Prieſt of good things that ſhould bee, by a greater and more perfect Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle not made with hands, that is to ſay, not of his building. Neither by the blood of Goates and Calues, but by his owne bloud, he entred once into the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly place and found eternal redemption. And in the 10. chap. verſ. 8. having ſayd before, that ſacrifice and offering, and burnt offerings, and offerings for ſin thou wouldſt not, neither hadſt pleaſure therin, (which are offered by the Law.) Then ſayth hee, Loe I come to doe thy will O God, he taketh then the firſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, to the end to eſtabliſh the ſecond. By the which Will we are ſanctified.

               <p>It followeth in the definiton, that of this Faith there commeth forth of the hearts of thoſe that are juſtified, a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall peace, joye, and conſolation.

               <p>HAving defined Faith and declared by particulars all the parts therof, it now remaines to know the cauſes that doe produce it.</p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:19488:31"/>
               <p>All effects haue ordinarily foure cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: the efficient, the materiall, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall, and the finall. As for the effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of Faith, it is produced and jngen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered of the grace of God; as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Epiſtle to the Epheſians chap. 2. verſe. 8. <hi>By grace yee are made ſafe through faith, and that not of your ſelues: it is the gift of God.</hi> The which grace by the Spirit of God diſpoſeth the hearts and the vnderſtandings of men jnteriourly, and ſecretly, taking away the naturall obſcurity and darkneſſe of the vnderſtanding, to make it capable of the knowledge of the word of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and the hardneſſe and obſtinacy of heart, that it may bee prepared with more alacrity and good will to follow that which the jlluminated vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding doth ſet before it. And even as for the ptoducement of all the fruites of the earth; it is firſt requiſite that the earth be good, and well tilled; ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the husbandman bee skilfull in his art, to wit, to ſtirre the earth and giue it all neceſſaries; thirdly, that the ſeed which is caſt vpon it be good, and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:19488:31"/> well covered, and watered with the dew of Heaven; ſo muſt man be prepared to receaue the jncorruptible ſeed of the word of God by the ſpirit of God, who doth regenerate &amp; change his heart of ſtone into a heart of fleſh. Afterwards that the Miniſter, which is the husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, be fit for to ſowe it with a graine that is pure and entire, and which is mingled neither with Darnell, nor any other evill ſeed. So by the concurrence of theſe three things, that is to ſay, the Spirit of God, which regenerates man, and prepares it ſelfe for his ſalvation, the good and faithfull Miniſter, who doth faithfully diſpence the miſteries of God; and the jncorruptible ſeed of the word which is purely and ſincerely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred. Faith is produced in the heart of a faithfull man; the which is not done but at Gods appoynted time, for men are called to the knowledge of their ſalvation diverſly, and at divers times, ſome ſooner, ſome later. And before Gods prefixed time be paſt, we ſee that the elect, as well as the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, are rebellious and contrary to the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:19488:32"/> word of God, whereof we haue a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble example in the Scripture of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who before the time of his vocation, was not onely an enemy, but alſo a blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>mer, and furious perſecutor of the Church of God. But when the time which God had appointed to call him, and to bring him jnto the Church, was come, then in a moment he was trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed from a Wolfe (which hee was before) to a Lambe. It is even like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a peece of woode which is layd vpon a harth, being greene one cannot kindle it, but if it be drye, ſo ſoone as it is put jnto the fire, and that it is blowed, it conceaues a flame, and ſo kindleth. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the producing of Faith, two things are required; the preparation of the heart, which is made by the ſpirit of God, and the word, the which doth jn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame the heart of man as ſoone as it is diſpoſed to receaue it. And even as to ſee bodily, it is requiſite firſt that the aire be jnlightened (for by night men cannot ſee though they haue eyes) and ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that both men and beaſts haue a liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faculty (for otherwiſe they could not
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:19488:32"/> ſee, were it even at noone day) ſo for to ſee and contemplate ſpirituall things, the ayre muſt firſt be jnlightened by the preaching of the word of God; and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that men haue eyes that are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to receaue this light. As for the materiall cauſe, they are thoſe thinges which Ieſus Chriſt hath done and ſuffered for vs, as the obedience which hee hath rendered to God his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the accompliſhment of the law, the ſatisfaction &amp; payment which hee hath made to Gods juſtice for our debts, the death, the curſe, the wrath and judgement of God which he hath ſuſtayned, and the hell, that is to ſay, the abiſme or bottomleſſe pit of all the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>rein he hath been plunged for vs, and for this only end, to free vs from them. It is the onely matter, ſubſtance, ſubject, and argument of our Faith. The fruits alſo that do ariſe of it, as the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the chu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:19488:33"/> becauſe the word of God written in the Bible touching theſe matters, in the bookes of the Prophets and Apoſtles, is of a large extent, and of difficult ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, the Apoſtles and the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors being aſſembled haue promiſed for it, and comprehended in a ſhort ſommary all that wee ought to beleeue for our ſalvation. And haue contayned in twelue little articles, all the things which Ieſus Chriſt hath done or ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for vs: And in generall all that is needfull for vs to beleeue, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon we ought to ground and ſettle the hope of the everlaſting life and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Wherevpon may be jnfered, that the doctrine of the Pope, and of all his Paſtors and Muncks of Papiſtry, cannot availe any thing to edifie our Faith, the which is not ſetled vpon the jnventions, fooliſh traditions, and vaine jmaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men, But vpon the pure word of God, the which ought to be layd o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in the church to the people purely and ſimply, without any mingling of dreames, &amp; ravenings of men; As ſaith the Prophet <hi>Ieremie,</hi>

                  <hi>You muſt not min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:19488:33"/> the chaffe among the good graine, nor the droſſe among the fine Siluer, nor the water with the good wine. Peter</hi> alſo wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth that <hi>if any one speake in the aſſembly,</hi>

                  <hi>let him ſpeake like the words of God.</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorteth his Diſciple to preach the word of God without adding or changing, <note place="margin">2. Tim. 4.</note> for as it written by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet. <note place="margin">Pſalm. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>The words of the Lord are pure words: euen as the ſiluer which from the earth is tryed and purified ſeuen times in the fire;</hi> for which cauſe nothing may bee mingled with it, but it muſt needs corrupt it.</p>
               <p>The third cauſe, to wit, the formall of Faith is Ieſus Chriſt, for as much as he is our Chriſt, that is to ſay, our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour and jnterceſſor. For in this qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity hee is as it were the forme of our Faith, the which hee quickneth and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth a being therevnto, as doth the ſhape to the matter which it ſhapeth, and vnto the which it is applyed. Now as we ſee all things take their being and denomination of their forme, as the fire is named by it forme, the fiſhes, the beaſts, the birds, and all things in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:19488:34"/> are called according to the forme which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hey beare. Alſo ſo is Faith, and calleth it ſelfe Chriſtian, becauſe that Ieſus Chriſt who is the forme thereof, and wee are alſo for this reaſon called Chriſtians, becauſe that wee are provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded therewith, which cauſeth that through Ieſus Chriſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e are regenerate to be new creatures. Moreover, it is he that hath kept the commandement of God. It is he who vndergoing the wrath and the malediction of the threatnings of God, hath delivered vs from them. Finally, it is he that obtayneth the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſet downe in the promiſe made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to his poſterity; and who, in doing ſo, hath beene a meanes that the law, the threatnings, and the promiſes, which are the three principall parts of the ſcripture were accompliſhed in his perſon, and by conſequent the Faith thereof healthfull to all belieuers. Whereby wee may ſay of Ieſus Chriſt, that hee is ths forme Faith, the which cannot ſubſiſt without the efficacy of the word, nor the word haue her effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy without him. Therefore is it that
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:19488:34"/> we may ſay that Ieſus Chriſt contaynes all the cauſes and par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s of Faith in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, for divers reſpects. Firſt the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, becauſe that as God he produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth it in vs by his ſpirit. As he did in <hi>Paul,</hi> when going jnto <hi>Damaſcus</hi> he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him, and in his mercy did change him in an jnſtant, and made him of a furious perſecutor of the Church, a faithfull ſervant vnto him and it. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, that hee is alſo the matter of our Faith, by reaſon of thoſe things which he hath ſuffered for vs, &amp; by the which (paying our ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſome) he hath fully ſatisfied to the juſtice of God for all our jniquities. Againe, that he is the forme of our Faith, in as much as he is the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour and jnterceſſour, who by his merite keepeth vs perpetually in the grace of God his Father, in the which reſteth all our life, ſalvation, and beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. And to conclude, that he is alſo the end thereof, becauſe it is hee vnto whome we ought wholy to referre and attribute the praiſe and glory of our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, which are the reaſons for the which it is ſayd, <note place="margin">Iohn. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>that in him conſists all
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:19488:35"/> fulneſſe of gifts and graces of God.</hi> Alſo, that God the Father hath giuen vs all things with him, that is to ſay, not only life, but alſo the meanes whereby wee may attaine therevnto. And that in him are all treaſures of the knowledge, wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and other graces and bleſſings of our God. Which conſidering, S. <hi>Augustine</hi> ſaith, <hi>That in our ſelues we are nothing, and that in him we are all things.</hi> And the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrues. Who is the cheefe and the accompliſher of our Faith, who inſteed of the ioy which he had in hand, hath indured the croſſe, hauing despiſed the ſhame, and is ſet at the right hand of the throne of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The finall cauſe, which is the fourth and laſt of Faith, is the glory of God and the ſalvation of men, for the mercy of God manifeſting it ſelfe in the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our ſinnes; and his vertue in the execution, and in the accompliſhment of his promiſes; and his juſtice in the paine which Ieſus Chriſt did endure vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the croſſe for vs; and his power in the diſcomfiting of our enemies; and his wiſedome by the which he hath by
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:19488:35"/> death brought life, by ſinne juſtice, by jnfirmitie force, by darkneſſe light, by wounds healing, by lowlineſſe exaltati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and by hell whither Ieſus Chriſt did deſcend, Paradice and the kingdome of Heaven; being (I ſay) all the vertues of God manifeſted and layd open in Ieſus Chriſt, all chriſtian men apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them by Faith, haue matter and cauſe to prayſe and glorifie God; for God doing that which is ſayd, hath ſhewed how glorious and wonderfull his name was.

               <p>THe ſecond effect of Faith is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſinnes, by the which the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance that men could not be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled with God, was taken away. For God being perfectly juſt, and we to the contrary moſt ſinfull and vnjuſt in every faſhion; there was no meanes to vnite vs vnto him, but that the ſinne and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice which was in vs, muſt firſt be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed. <note place="margin">2. Cor. 6.</note> And as ſayth the Apoſtle, <hi>What fellowſhip hath righteouſnes with vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſnes; or what communion hath light with darkenes; or what concord hath Chriſt with Beliall; either what part hath he that belieueth, with an Infidell; or what
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:19488:38"/> agreement hath the Temple of God with Idols;</hi> for (as the Philoſophers ſay) two things that are quite contrary, cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in one and the ſame ſubject. It was then needfull that the ſinne which was in vs, ſhould be aboliſhed, before we could be capable to come neere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, and to bee joyned with him. Now this aboliſhment was done for the remiſſion of our ſinnes, the which God gaue vs by his grace, and by the meanes of the ſatisfaction which Ieſus Chriſt made for it by his death; the which ſatisfaction is allowed and jmpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto vs by the faith which we haue in him. And it is the article of Faith which we proteſt to beleeue in the end of our confeſſion, ſaying, I belieue the remiſſion of ſinnes. Wherevpon wee muſt note one thing which S. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſayth, that is to ſay, Even as the grace of God continueth towards vs for ever, and that the efficacy and vertue of the death of Ieſus Chriſt is perpetuall; alſo is the remiſſion and abolition of all our jniquities which come thereof, perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, without being any whit jnterrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:19488:39"/> So that as it is written in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 9.10.</note> 
                  <hi>That we are continually ſprinckled with the bloud of Ieſus Chriſt, the which is neuer clutterd, but is alwaies freſh to be powred vppon vs, to waſh vs and to cleanſe vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all our filthines.</hi> And we may ſay of this bloud, and of the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſinnaes, which is therein eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, that it is the <hi>Aſile</hi> &amp; the freedome of Chriſtians, whither they muſt alway haue their recourſe, to bee warranted, and to ſaue their life, when they haue chanced to commit any criminall cauſe.</p>
               <p>And that may be very well fitted to this purpoſe, which S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſayth in his booke of the Cittie of God; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a compariſon between the Church and Roome in this poynt, that is to ſay, that as to people and edifie the Citie of <hi>Roome</hi> in her beginning, by the aduiſe of <hi>Romulus,</hi> the firſt building that was there ſet vp, was the place of Libertie and Freedome, after the framing wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, hee cauſed a Proclamation to bee made in all the places thereabouts, that who ſo euer found himſelfe to haue committed any capitall crime, retyring
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:19488:39"/> himſelfe into this pace of Freedome, he ſhould obtaine his fauour, and ſhould be receaued into the place of Citizen, and defended by the Inhabitants a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all thoſe that ſhould doe him any violence. Alſo in the Church of God, the firſt thing that was publiſhed was the remiſſion of ſinnes, which is as it were a place of freedome, into the which thoſe malefactors that haue deſerved death and the halter, may retyre them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues; to the end to be aſſured of their life, and from the ſentence and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, which the judge might giue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, if hee were not hindered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it, by reaſon of their refuge thither, and that they are receaued into the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and ſafegard of the King, who is the Protector and warrant of the Church. As then the Citie of Roome in her beginning was peopled but with theeues, robbers, murderers, and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple abandoned to all kinds of vices, by the meanes of the place of Freedome, which had beene opened for them, by the founder of Rome; ſo is the Church aſſembled &amp; compounded of jdolaters,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:19488:40"/> blaſphemers, prophaners, drunkards, rebels, theeues, adulterers, murderers, evill ſpeakers, detractours, covetous, ambitious, and voluptuous perſons, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhers, robbers, and other ſuch like perſons, by the meanes of the remiſſion of ſinnes, which hath been opened vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, as a place of Freedome to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre themſelues in ſafty. The which did <hi>Adam, Abell, Enoc, Noe, Abraham, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaac, Iacob, Samuel, Gedeon, Iephte, Sampſon, Dauid,</hi> the Prophets, the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and all the Saints that ever were. Now this remiſſion of ſins is the ground of the hope of a chriſtian man, and of all conſolation. For ſeeing wee offend ſo many wayes, and that wee cannot liue a moment and minute of an bower, without having evill thoughts in our vnderſtandings, evill affections in our hearts, evill words in our mouths, evill actions in our hands, and in all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of our bodyes, and a great vanity in all our ſences. What ſhould we doe? how ſhould we eſcape? wherevppon ſhould we aſſure our ſalvation, withot-the fayth which we haue of the remiſſiu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:19488:40"/> of our ſinnes? which is as it were a plaiſter &amp; a tent, which wee apply euery day vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this moiſt &amp; corrupted wound of our nature, and which feſtured doth alwaies drop, without ſtenching, dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, clea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſing or healing, by other means but by this onely remedy, the which is altogether neceſſary for the converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our life, and to hinder that the rotteneſſe, ſpreading it ſelfe, and ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping ouer all the parts thereof, in the end ſhould not cauſe vs to dye.

                  <note place="margin">Rom. 5.</note> In this onely gift of the remiſſion of our ſinnes, wee haue matter and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to admyre and exalt the jmmenſe and jncomprehenſible mercy of God, which is never weary of giving vs grace for ſo many ſinnes which we haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted every day.

The which we ſee in the parable of the bad ſervant, wherof mention is made in S. <hi>Mathew</hi> chap. 18. and in the example of <hi>Dauid</hi> who wondering at the greatneſſe of the goodneſſe and mercy of God, ſayd in his prayſe. <note place="margin">Pſal. 32.</note>

We haue two notable examples, <note place="margin">Examples.</note> the one in the Scripture, the other in nature, which we ought alwayes to ſet before our eyes, to vphold and aſſure vs in all our afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. To wit, firſt the Buſh which <hi>Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> ſaw in the deſart, <note place="margin">The Buſh.</note> the which bejng all on fire, was not burnt nevertheleſſe, nor conſumed nor brought to aſhes. Which did ſignifie to vs the eſtate &amp; condition
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:19488:54"/> of the Church, the which is alwayes as it were on fire in this world, &amp; as it were in a fournace, without that the force &amp; vehemence of the fire hath any power to conſume it, no more then the young men which <hi>Nebucadnezar</hi> cauſed to be caſt jnto the fiery fournace, becauſe they would not obtemperate, nor obay the vnjuſt commandement which he made them, to obey the ſtature which they had erected. The other, is in that which God propounds vnto vs in nature, to wit, <note place="margin">The bird Alcyon.</note> of the byrd <hi>Alcyon,</hi> to whome God giveth leaſure in the middeſt of the hardeſt of Winter, to build his neſt vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the high rockes in the Sea, which for the ſpace of 14. dayes is as calme and peaceable, or rather more than in the heart of Sommer, vntill ſuch time as their young ones are diſcloſed, and fledged to fly away. So God at all times hath ſo conducted the affaires of his Church, that in the middeſt of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt and moſt horrible tempeſts that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver were, he hath alwaies preſerved it, and hath furniſhed and prepared for it ſome little place to make her neſt and

               <p>We ſee every day, <note place="margin">Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to Patience.</note> that in the night the cleareneſſe and light of the Starres doth appeare, and that in day time they are covered, in ſo much that the beauty and ſplendour of them is not ſeene. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo we ſee that the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that is to ſay, the faithfull, which in the ſcripture are compared vnto Starres, in their adverſitie do much more ſhew the brightneſſe of their Faith, patience, and magnanimitie, then they do in proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. Moreover, how dare we hope one day to participate in the trivmpha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t glory of Ieſus Chriſt, if in this world we doe not with patience participate in his croſſe? How alſo can we hope to attaine to eternall life without patience, ſeejng that the way which leadeth thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, bejng full of Bryars and thornes, cannot bee paſſed, but they will catch them that keepe it, or walke therein; the which cannot be done without having great occaſion and matter of patience, the which ſheweth it ſelfe more in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, then it doth in dojng or perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming; as ſheweth the Apoſtle to the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:19488:55"/> 
                  <hi>Hebrewes:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> where he praiſeth the faith and patience of thoſe great and jlluſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſons, that by Faith haue comba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Kingdomes, haue done juſtice, haue obtayned the promiſes, haue clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Lions jawes, haue quenched the vehemency of the fire, haue avoyded the edge of the Swoord, haue ſhewed themſelues ſtrong in battaile, haue dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen backe the ſtrangers Camps. And then a little after prayſeth thoſe that haue byn tried by mockings and ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings, yea moreover by bonds and jm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, they were ſtoned, they were hewen in ſunder, they were tempted, they were ſlayne with the Sword, they wandred vp and downe in ſheeps skins, and in Goats skinnes, bejng deſtitute, afflicted, and tormented, whome the world was not worthy of, they wande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Wilderneſſes and Mountains, and dennes, and caues of the earth. The which the Apoſtle hath very well noted to giue vs to vnderſtand, that the Faith and patience of the faithfull, is as much or more to be prayſed, for the conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and vertue which it hath to ſuffer
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:19488:55"/> and endure great torments, as it is to doe great and memorable exploits. As we doe not leſſe praiſe the patience of Iob, in the loſſes of his goods, and children, and great dolours, which he conſtantly endured in his body, then the paines, trauailes, and great patience which Ioſua had to diſcomfort the 32. Kings of the Cananites. Let vs then conclude, that the patience which Faith bringeth vnto vs and produceth in vs, is a very excellent and laudable vertue, and which maketh vs not onely Inuincible againſt the temptations and ſleights vſed againſt vs by our enemies, but alſo victorious; ſo that wee may ſay, that the wicked in their rage, are matter for God to jlluſtrate and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his glory in the faithfull who ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount them in their patience and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimitie.</p>

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:19488:91"/> Charitie, Hope, <note place="margin">Slaunders of Sophiſts againſt the pure do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Faith, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed.</note> perſeuerance &amp; good workes: becauſe that the Schole di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines ſaye, that Faith and good workes are things diuided: ſo that the one may be without the other: whereby they take occaſion to callumniate and defame vs, ſaying, that wee preach no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Faith, and ſay nothing of good workes, as if they were vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table; and they goe farther, ſaying, that it ſeemes that wee would bring into Kingdomes and common wlealths, a licentiouſneſſe and looſeneſſe: ſo that euery one may haue no other rule to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine the ſtate of his Life and manners, but his ſences and appetites. Now it is very needefull to reiect and confute ſuch a ſlaunder, which is directly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the honour and glory of God, and the health and preſeruation of all Eſtates in the world. For what were it if ſuch a confuſion were once eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed? that euery one might liue at his pleaſure and at his fancy, hauing nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther law nor reaſon to controle his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and his actions, were it not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ouerthrow the order which god
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:19488:92"/> loueth, and will haue eſtabliſhed in all things? For as ſayth <hi>Philon</hi> there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing fayre nor pleaſant in diſorder and confuſion. Wherevpon we may inferre, that there is nothing more diſpleaſing and abhominable before God, then to liue diſordinately, And to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that there is nothing more agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, then to ſee thinges well ruled and meaſured, and altogether confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to holy Lawes and ordinances which hee hath cauſed vs to publiſh to this effect. <note place="margin">Libertines juſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected.</note> Let vs then proteſt that wee will not in any wiſe approoue the pernicious and diueliſh error of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertines, who will liue at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, without being at all ſubiect to blame, correction, and reprehenſion, nor will not bee reprooued nor bridled in their diſordinate affections, &amp; could willingly wiſh, that they were let run by aduenture, after their appetites, like a horſe without a bridle, and a ſhippe without a Rudder. Now as for vs, wee declare and proteſt againe before God and men, that the greateſt greefe and torment that we haue in our minde, is
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:19488:92"/> to ſee in that manner the greateſt part of men diſſolute and diſordered. And the occaſions which they giue to the Ignorant and jnfidels, ſo to blaſpheme the name of God, and the doctrine which we profeſſe, as they do ordinary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. I therefore beſeech the readers of this treatiſe that they diligently note al the reaſons that are heere deducted and diſcourſed, to ſhew that Faith is neuer ſeparated from good workes, no more then the fire his brightneſſe and light.</p>

So the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> perſecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is a moſt aſſured teſtimonie to the faithfull, that they ſhall participate in the glory of their head and euerlaſting life. From thence it commeth that the Apoſtle reioyceth with the <hi>Phillippians,</hi> becauſe it hath been giuen vnto them for Chriſts ſake, not onely to beleeue in him, but alſo to ſuffer for him. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.29. Wrighting to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> we our ſelues (ſayth hee) boaſt of you in the Churches of God, becauſe of your patience and Faith in all the perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and afflictions which you vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe, the which are a manifeſt demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the judgement of God, that you may be reputed worthy of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:19488:150"/> For the which alſo you ſuffer. 2. <hi>Theſſa.</hi> 1.4.5. The ſame point of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is treated in the 12. Chap. of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrues.</hi> And as it was needefull that the head of the Church ſhould ſuffer, and by the way of the croſſe enter into glory: alſo it is fitting that by many tribulations, the members of his bodie ſhould enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen. Let vs then conclude, that the ſufferings for Ieſus Chriſt, doe maruailouſly confirme the hope of his raigne.</p>

               <note place="margin">Hope is a ſingular guift.</note> Beſides, as Faith is a ſinguler gift of God, ſo is hope, for as much as by pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the beleeuers wayte for theſe great good things which haue been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed them. Therefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> wiſhed fervently that the Faithfull might haue the eyes of their vnderſtanding opened, to knowe what was the hope of their vocation, and the excellencie of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the glory of his inheritance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Saints: <hi>Ephe.</hi> 1.18. Let vs then alſo pray vnto the Lord, that hee would more and more confirme in our hearts the hope of eternall life. Let vs
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:19488:150"/> hope that hee will do it, ſeeing his gifts and his calling is without repentance, and that he goeth on to the end with the good worke which hee hath begun in his elect. Let vs yet conſider, that the nature of hope agreeth altogether with that of Faith: That is to ſay, it is aſſured, perpetuall, liuely, of efficacie in thoſe that are regenerate hoping in God. Seeing that hope proceedeth and dependeth of Faith which maintay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth it, neceſſaryly hope is ſuch as Faith is: ſo that the faithfull truely hoping, although that, ſhooke with diuers ſorts of temptations, it neuer falleth by deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing altogether; becauſe that chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an hope is ſetled vppon the ſolide and firme foundations aboue ſpoken of, not vppon humane ſtrength, dignities, or promiſes.

It is the teſtimonie of Iuſtification alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy apprehended, following that which the Lord ſayd to the Woman ſinner, whereof hath byn ſpoken before. 2. It is not altogether perfect in this preſent life: but ſhall bee in the life eternall, namely after the reſurrection. <hi>Charitie</hi> (ſayth S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.8.) <hi>doth neuer fall away, whereas as for the Propheſies, they ſhall be aboliſhed: and as for the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, they ſhall ceaſe: as for knowledge, it ſhall be aboliſhed.</hi> 3. Whether wee conſider the houſhold of Faith, or other men, Charity is well ordered; To this purpoſe it is ſayd, Gal. 6.10. <hi>Whiles
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:19488:157"/> we haue time, let vs doe good to all, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally to the houſhould of Faith.</hi> 4. A ſeruile feare doth much hinder mens conſciences in the execution of that which appertaineth to their dutie, and in the exerciſes of patience where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Charity remedieth, as ſaith S. <hi>Iohn</hi> in his 1. Epiſtle chap. 4. ver. 18. <hi>There is no feare in loue, but perfect loue casteth out feare, for feare hath painefulneſſe, and he that feare this not perfect in loue.</hi> 5. The rule of indifferent workes and actions, is Charity, witnes the acts of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> the circumſicion of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothie,</hi> and ſuch like in the chriſtian primitiue Church. <hi>To the weake</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Paul) I became as weake, that I might winne the weake.

Mathew 22.37. <hi>&amp;c. Thou ſhalt loue the Lord thy God with all thine heart, with all thy ſoule, and with all thy mind. This is the firſt and the great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement. And the ſecond is like vnto that, Thou ſhalt loue thy neighbour as thy

It may be ſayd that charitie is ſuperiour and inferiour to Faith; but in diuers reſpects inferiour, by reaſon of iuſtification, of her originall, and of her meaſure. <hi>For we are iustified by Faith,</hi> Rom. 3.27. <hi>not by charity,</hi> the which ſheweth <hi>That we are iustified,</hi> Iames. 2.18.21. From faith commeth charity: and that which faith apprehendeth, is aſſured and accompliſhed; but chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie hath her progreſſions and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings: in ſumme, faith is the meaſure of it, and hee to whome God ſheweth moſt mercy, more that man loueth God and his neighbours. <note place="margin">Why cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie is the greateſt.</note> But on the other ſide, Charity is ſuperiour. 1.

Secondly, that which is ſaid is thought ſimply ſpoken in ſome reſpect. Charity is not ſimply greater then faith: but in regard of the during of the holyneſſe of life begunne in vs. Thirdlie it is as if one ſhould ſay, A King is greater and more raiſed in dignity aboue ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious Goldſmith his ſubiect; then he maketh a bowle or a chaine of gould better then this goldſmith. The head is more excellent the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the feet, we ought then to walke with our head, and not with our feet. As much may bee ſayd of other excellent parts of the body in compariſon of ſome leſſe, which haue their proper vſe. And although there be ſome diſſemblance or vnlikelyhoode in theſe examples, yet this is firme, that as the ſences and the members of the body haue their obiects and diſtinct of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, ſo muſt wee diſtinctly aſſigne to Faith, Hope, and Charity, that which is ſpeciall and proper vnto them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out confounding by our vnaptnes, that which God will haue diſtinct and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:19488:159"/> conſidered. <note place="margin">whether Charitie giueth forme to Faith.</note> Thoſe haue alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued themſelues, that haue maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that charity giueth forme to faith, and hath finiſhed it, like as the matter receaueth acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pliſhment of her forme. And it is a vaine jmagination, to thinke and ſay, that the forme of one diſtinct quality onely is another quality diſtinct of the forme by the definition thereof. The forme of faith ſheweth it ſelfe in the intelligence and apprehenſion of the promiſe of grace; that of charitie in the loue of God and of our neighbours; the one and the other worketh by their nature and efficacy, beſides who is the man of vnderſtanding that will main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that the thing ingendered, hath the forme of the Ingenderer? Now faith ingendereth hope and charitie, whereof ſhee is the next cauſe. Therefore, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the one nor the other ought to bee taken for the forme of faith. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, as the morall vertues are not the formes of vertues intellectuall; ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther charitie nor hope ought to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the forme of Faith.</p>
            <p>Beſides, the guift of charitie is moſt

Corinth. 13.) <hi>with the tongues of men and Angels, and haue not loue, I am as ſounding braſſe or a tinckling Cymbale.</hi> Againe, without charity men cannot find peace nor agreement in any companie whatſoeuer. <hi>Hatred bringeth diſcord; but charitie couereth all faults,</hi> Prou. 10.12. 1. Pet. 4.8. <hi>He that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth his brother, hee abydeth in the light, and there is no occaſion of euill in him.</hi> 1. Ioh. 2.10. We walke now by faith, not in ſight. Charitie ſhall be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed and made greater in euerlaſting life, without changing of ſort; but faith ſhall haue her accompliſhment ſeeing the good denounced and belieued of all preſent. We ſee now through a glaſſe obſcurely, but then we ſhall ſee face to face, now I know in part, but then I ſhal know, as I haue alſo beene knowne, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12. Hope alſo ſhall then bee aboliſhed, all euill being done away, the teares wiped from our eyes, which ſhall
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:19488:160"/> ſee the things preſent which wee hoped for, for the hope which is ſeene, is not hope: for why ſhould any one hope for that which he ſeeth? <hi>But if we hope for that which we ſee not, then we wayte for it in patience,</hi> Rom. 8.23.24. Then as we now poſſeſſe by hope this inheritance which S. <hi>Paul</hi> calleth incorruptible, which cannot contaminate, nor wither; alſo wee ſhall one day bee in effect co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heires with Ieſus Chriſt, to enioye this inheritance indiuiſiblie and eternally. The doctrine of charity, as alſo that of faith and hope, amply expounded in the bookes of the Prophets and Apoſtles, is preciſely and articularly comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the catechiſmicke queſtions and anſweres. And as wee muſt drawe the ſummarie of the doctrine of Faith, and of hope out of the ſymbole or creede of the Apoſtles, and the dominicall prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that of charitie is found in the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue. That which repugneth againſt the articles therein contained, ought to bee deteſted as erroneous and pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. For following the precept of the Apoſtle, 2. Tim. 1, 13. <hi>We muſt keepe
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:19488:161"/> the true patterne of the wholeſome words, and the good intent by the holy ghoſt which dwelleth in vs.</hi> It is fitting alſo to auoyd all prophane and vaine babblings, and the contradicting of a ſcience falſly ſo named, 1, <hi>Tim</hi> 6, 20.</p>
            <p>In the conſideration of the 10. article propounded in the Title. Let vs firſt treate of the workes of charitie towards our neighbours. 2. Let vs riſe to the contemplation of the doctrine of good workes. 3. Let vs ſpeake as ſhortly as may bee, of the vertues commanded and recommended to all Chriſtians vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe words, <hi>Thou ſhalt loue thy God with all thy heart, and thy neighbour as thy ſelfe.</hi>

            <p n="1">1. In the conſideration of the firſt point heare treated generally, let vs ſee the reaſons which ought to mooue vs to Charitie towards our neighbours. Afterwards what kind of works of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie are the principall. Alſo the rules to the which all may be referred. Now although that the commaundement of God, our dutie, the doctrine of Faith, of repentance, and of the judgements
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:19488:161"/> and puniſhments temporall and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, ought to induce all chriſtians to true obedience towards the Lord: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding it ſhall ſuffice to touch that which ought to mooue vs to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, the obiect, then the end thereof. The commaundement of God ought to haue great ſway which beareth that we ſhould loue our neighbour as our ſelues. If this friendſhip proceedes of a pure heart, the effect thereof followeth at neede. Let vs ioyne to the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of the Faith of the chriſtian that obayeth. That worketh by chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and it cannot bee that the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate man can be guided by the ſpirit of enuie, rancour, and crueltie, for the markes of the diſciples of the Lord, is that they loue one another in him, whoſe example, aboue al in the behoofe of Charitie to his neighbours, is ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his to inſtruct them, as he ſaid ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly to them the night before hee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and doth there exhort them moſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately, according as S. <hi>Iohn</hi> repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it in the 13.14.15. &amp; 16.

Who ſo reuerenceth this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour in the qualitie of a gift of God, ought to follow him as an example and patron of vertue. And who ſo doth otherwiſe looſeth the gift, and beareth the name of a chriſtian in vaine, yea to his great condemnation. This jmitation doth not conſiſt in equalitie nor in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, but in a feruent deſire, a holy will, and a perſeuerant continuance.</p>

There is a double neighbourhood: the one is naturall, the other ſpirituall; the naturall draweth vs to all men as well Faithfull as infidels.

Wee are neighbours the one to the other by order of creation: for in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the ſubſtance of our originall, wee are all come of Adam, by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent neighbours in him. 2. One man is neighbour to an other, becauſe he is a man endowed with a body and ſoule, and hauing been all firſt created in our firſt Father after the Image of God, whereof yet ſome trace doth appeare, yea in the miſerable ſinners, ſo farre foorth, that after the deluge God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning murder expreſly, ſayth theſe words, whoſoeuer hath ſhedde mans bloud, by man his bloud ſhall bee ſhed; for God made man after his owne I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage;

In regard of the common life and of the ſocietie of men, wherein one bodie hath neede of the helpe and aſſiſtance of the other; the rich men no leſſe, ſometimes more, then the poore. In this ſocietie are found diuers particular degrees, part of conſanguinitie, of affinitie, of publicke and domeſtick charge, part of diuers ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities and difficulties which preſent at all times in the courſe of humane life, This naturall aſſociation of the children of Adam together, ought ſufficiently to teach them, to loue one another; which the Philoſophers haue well comprehended, according as their books witneſſe; wherein they ſhew that the vſe of reaſon &amp; ſpeech was giuen to man, to the end that the one might tell the other, what he iudgeth conuenient to require and to giue eaſe. <note place="margin">The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall.</note> The ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall ſocietie is of Chriſtians among themſelues, wherevnto they are drawne by a fouer-fowld neceſſitie. 1. Of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation; ſeeing they are borne the children of God by the ſeede of his holy word. 2. Of the miſticall body, being
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:19488:163"/> made members of that body whereof Chriſt our Sauiour is the head. 3. Of the common vocation; for wee haue been called in vnitie of ſpirit by the bond of peace. 4, Of a happie life; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe wee ſhall enioye together eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in common, and without diuiſion, the celeſtiall inheritance, and the glory prepared therein. This Spirituall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction ſheweth ſufficiently how chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ought to be affectionate the one towards the other. Can any thing be found better then to ſee the children of God allied and knit together by band of perfection? what body is more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to behold, then that miſticall body holding together ſo wel in whole and in euery part indiuiſibly conioyned?

All

            <p>There are fower ends of the works of Charity. <note place="margin">Diuers ends of the workes of charitie.</note> 1. The firſt is the glory of God, for God is glorified in the good works of his children. 2. The ſecond, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in the mutuall releefe of the members of the miſticall body of Ieſus Chriſt. 3. The third is the edification of our neighbours. For when one ſeeth an other affected to brotherly charitie, ſuch an example doth comfort, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite them to their duty. 4. The fowrth is the recompence promiſed to him that ſhall giue a glaſſe of cold water, to one
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:19488:164"/> of the leaſt of the diſciples or members of the Lord. It ſeemeth by that which S. <hi>Luc.</hi> writeth in the 6. chap. verſe 37. that Ieſus Chriſt recommendeth fower ſorts of Charitie to his. <note place="margin">4. Sorts of workes of charitie.</note> Which all chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are bound to remember inceſſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. 1. The firſt is, that wee ſhould neuer judge ſiniſterly of our neighbour, but rather haue him in good eſtimation, hoping ſtill of his amendment from good, to better. Not that this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth chriſtians to ſhut their eyes and make no difference betweene truth and lying, betweene honeſt and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men. But onely it is required, that the Faithfull amiably affected towards their neighbours, ſhould not ſuffer themſelues to be tickled with curious enuie, in penetrating farther then pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie requireth, into the behauiours of their neighbours, but ſhould retaine themſelues and curb ſhort their preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate judgements. 2. The ſecond, that we ſhould not vſe to our confuſion that which is the common ſaying, A fooliſh judge a briefe judgement, in condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our neighbours abſent, or preſent,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:19488:165"/> without hearing him, and ſpeaking of him at randome, but rather to ſpeake gently of him, without ſlaunder, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding that which wee vnderſtand according as charitie requireth. 3. The third is to pardon the faults committed againſt vs, to ſuch as ſhall aske vs par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, following the promiſe of the Lord, forgiue, and it ſhall bee forgiuen you; as if he ſhould ſay, as you ſhall deale with your neighbours, God will deale with you. And hee himſelfe declareth it very expreſly, by a good ſimilitude in the verſe following, in theſe words; <hi>With what meaſure you meate, ſhall bee meaſured vnto you.</hi> 4. The fowrth, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth that wee ſhould in effect aſſiſt our neighbours: which the Lord ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth in particular, in the formularie of the ſentence propounded to his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and which hee will pronounce at the latter day. There is no ſpeech of contracts, of lending and borrowing, of buying and ſelling, and other ſuch like, whereby the contractours ought to know in their conſciences, whether they followe the rule of Charitie, but
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:19488:165"/> Ieſuſ Chriſt ſpeaketh of giuing, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent condemneth vſuries, rapines, and cruelties ſo ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> taxed in the whole Scripture, and bringeth his to the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of this holie and precious ſentence, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.35. <hi>That it is a happier thing to giue, then to receaue;</hi> a ſentence that condemnes almoſt all the Chriſtians that liue in the world at this day. <note place="margin">Rules of chariti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>There reſteth three rules to propound to Chriſtians in the exerciſe of the workes of charitie. 1. The word of God. 2. Faith. 3. Charitie it ſelfe. jn theſe three rules is incloſed the means to acquite our ſelues of our duties. As for the world, let vs take for example that which <hi>Salomon</hi> ſayth, Prou. 5.15. <hi>Drinke the water of thy Cesternes, and the liuely waters out of the middeſt of thy well; let the ſprings runne out, let them bee for thee onely, not for the strangers that are with thee.</hi> He will firſt that euery one ſhould haue the vſe of his goods to his owne commoditie, according as his condition requireth. Afterwards hee treateth of the liberalitie of him that hath much, and will haue them to bee
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:19488:166"/> liberall towards thoſe that haue little: that he hoard it not vp, but that he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute ſome part of it to others. Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in regard of the poſſeſſion, that men ſhould auoyd bad huſbandry and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digalitie, for feare leaſt they ſhould fall into want. Faith regardeth the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement and the promiſe of God. By the commaundement the chriſtian man is ſollicited to ſhew himſelfe chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table: and by the fathers promiſe is enticed to diſcharge his dutie cheereful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and with alacrity. As for Charitie, it is mooued with the commodities and jncommodities of our neighbours, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycing with the ioyefull, lamenting with the ſorrowfull, ſuffering with ſome by chriſtian compaſſion, and bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the burthen of another with a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and cordiall affection. <note place="margin">Of almes, the ſpeciall worke of chriſtian Charitie.</note> Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we riſe to the contemplation of the doctrine of good works, we will adde a conſideration of the ſpeciall worke of a chriſtian, which we call Almes, which the Latines did call <hi>Eleemoſina,</hi> from the Greeke word <hi>Eleemoſyne,</hi> deriued from the verbe <hi>Elleeo,</hi> which ſignifieth,
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:19488:166"/> I haue pittie and compaſſion, to ſhewe the ſpring from whence almes done to our neighbours ought to come, and the faults committed by thoſe that doe no almes but in vaine glorie, in reproach, in iniuries, in deſpight, in grudging, perforce, and for faſhion ſake, &amp;c. S. <hi>Iohn</hi> declareth in fewe woordes many things in the 3. chap. of his firſt Epiſtle verſ. 17. <hi>He that hath the goods of this world, and ſhall ſee his brother in neceſſity, and ſhutteth vp his compaſſion from him, how dwelleth the loue of God in him?</hi> He ſhutteth vp his compaſſion from the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted that ſheweth him no pittifull af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, that turneth his backe towards him, that thruſteth him from him and ſkorneth him, ſending him backe emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that doth not aſſiſt him ſpeedily, cheerefully, and ſufficiently according to his ſmall power. But whoſoeuer, with a true compaſſion, ſupplyeth to his neighbours neceſſities, it may bee ſayd to them that he openeth his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion towards them. And this word ſheweth an intimate charitie, which is as it were faſtened to the moſt noble in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:19488:167"/> parts of the bodie, a vehement pittie and mercy, which is to be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to thoſe of mothers towards their little children, which they loue and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh tenderly and with an vnſpeakeable care. Then how execrable are the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell and vnpittifull men, who ſo many wayes diſhonour the precious name of a chriſtian, and boaſt of vaine titles, diffamed before God by reaſon of their furious inſolencies towards the poore? What volume might ſerue to the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription of their miſchiefs, if not Gods bookes? <hi>Apoc.</hi> 20.12. Thoſe ſurely will ſuffice; for S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſayth there, <hi>That thoſe that are dead ſhall bee iudged by the things written in the bookes, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their workes.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">What wee muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider in doing of Almes.</note> For to vnderſtand what it is to doe almes, let vs conſider the cauſes which ought to ſtirre vs vp to doe it. 2.

To what ends we muſt be almoners. 5. The fruites of this worke of Charitie. 1. For the firſt article, whereof hath been ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken before, the profeſſion of chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:19488:167"/> the commandement of God aſwell in the Law as in the Goſpell, the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the head of the Church, and of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers members thereof in many ages, the dignitie and worth of the almes done in faith and ſincere affection, the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the poore neighbour, the threatnings of God againſt thoſe that are cruell, are very pricking goads to put forward all good chriſtians in the way of their dutie. <hi>The wrath of God is vpon the couetous and ſuch as are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the poore, hee curſeth them, ſends backe their prayers,</hi> as ſayth <hi>Salomon,</hi> Prou. 21.13. <hi>ſtrips ſuch vnthankefull ones of their gifts, curſeth their poſteritie.</hi> 2. As for the affection of him that doth almes, <note place="margin">2. Of the affection to do charitie.</note> let him firſt flye hipocriſie and vaine glory, enemies of the true faith, of the feare of God, of loue towards neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; afterwards let him be mooued with ſincere loue and dilection towards God and the poore body which he is to ſuccour, proceeding in all this deede cheerefully and ſincerely. Theſe affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are as the ſalt of almes before God, who deſireth to haue cheerefull
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:19488:168"/> and glad giuers, who do not open their purſe in chiding of the poore, but who preſent to their ſoueraigne their purſe and their heart, making themſelues friendes with vnlawfull riches, and a good treaſure in Heauen. <hi>Hee deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth much in ſuch offrings,</hi> Heb. 13.16.

As touching the meane, he that hath much, let him not be a nigard: he that hath lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, let him giue cherefully of that little, like vnto the poore widow who giuing but a myte, was preferred by Ieſus Chriſt before the rich who caſt Siluer by handfuls into the box of the Temple. Secondly, it is fitting that there be ſome counterpoyze betweene the giuer and the poore receauer: the one adorned with free charity and alacrity; the other with acknowledgement and thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing. Thirdly, one may vſe diſcretion, <hi>Regarding the houſhould of Faith,</hi> then others, according to the rule of S. <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 6.10. Finally, let them haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to their faculties, that they doe not
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:19488:168"/> waſte them all at once, but to remaine maiſter of them, to the end they may diſtribute them with reaſon, according to the rules of dutie, in the vocation whervnto men are called. 4. We ought to do almes, to the end that our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour may be ſuccoured, with diuers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefs marked by the Lord. In S. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.

For concluſion, it is to the end that God may be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. The fruites and profits of our almes are great and diuers. <note place="margin">Of the fruits and profits of Almes.</note> S. <hi>Paul</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſteth that thoſe that are liberall and charitable to the poore, ſhall abound in all good works: and our Lord promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth that God will reward them openly. The Pſalmes of <hi>Dauid</hi> and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbs of <hi>Salomon,</hi> are full of excellent promiſes to this purpoſe. Let vs adde
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:19488:169"/> one out of <hi>Eſay</hi> in the 58. chap. verſ. 7. &amp; following. <hi>The faste which I haue cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen is it not that thou breake thy bread to him that is hungrie? and that thou cauſe thoſe that are in poore eſtate to come to thyne houſe? when thou ſeeſt him that is naked, that thou euen couer him, and that thou hide not thy ſelfe behind thy fleſh? Then ſhall thy light appeare like the break of day, and thy health ſhall come preſently, thy righteouſneſſe ſhall goe before thee, and the glory of the Lord ſhall embrace thee.

If thou openeſt thy heart to him that is hungry, and that thou ſatiſfie the afflicted: thy light ſhall come foorth in darkeneſſe, and thy darkeneſſe ſhall he as the noone day: and the Lord ſhall conduct thee continually, and ſhall refreſh thy ſoule in the great droughts, and ſhall fatten thy bones; and thou ſhalt be like a watered Garden, and like a ſpring whereof the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters doe not faile: and there ſhall come of

Thirdly, the party juſtified, deploreth (with <hi>Dauid</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi>) his miſery be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, reſiſteth his euill affections growing from day to day in thoſe that are leaſt jmparfect, prayeth that God would not impute ſo many filthineſſes and jmperfections which appeare on euery ſide vnto him. In the fowrth place although that the partie iuſtified by Faith, acknowledgeth his defaults, this neuertheleſſe abides reſolute in him that God requireth obedience, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though jmperfect, and that the ſame is pleaſing vnto him for the loue of Ieſus Chriſt, as ſayth S. <hi>Peter,</hi> you are an holy Prieſthoode to offer vppe ſpirituall ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice acceptable to GOD by Ieſus Chriſt, 1. <hi>Peter.</hi> chap. 2. verſ. 5.

               <note place="margin">4. Why we ought to doe good workes</note> As for the fowrth point, many vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding that man is iuſtified before God by Faith onely, without works, do make iniquity of the cauſes which ought to inflame and prick vs forward to good works. This queſtion muſt be anſwered by the ſcriptures, which propound three important cauſes, to wit. <note place="margin">The ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie of them.</note> Neceſſitie, Dignitie, Reward. Let vs breefely ſpeake of theſe three. Neceſſitie, is diſtinguiſhed into fiue articles: to wit, of Commandement, of dutie, of Faith, of repentance, and of exemption from puniſhment, euery one which ought ſufficiently to ſtirre vs vppe to do well. Firſt, the creature muſt neceſſarily obay to the Cteator. Then when the Lord ſeriouſly and ſeuerely commandeth that wee obay him, who ſeeth not that Chriſtians ought of all neceſſitie to ſtudie to do good works? Walke ſayth hee, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 20.19. in my
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:19488:173"/> commaundements: and S. <hi>Paul,</hi> This is the will of God, that is to ſay, your ſanctification; 1. <hi>Theſſalo.</hi> 4.3. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the neceſſity of the dutie, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle noteth it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.12. in theſe words, <hi>Wee are debtours not to the fleſh to liue according to the fleſh. For if you liue according to the fleſh, you die: but if by the ſpirit you mortifie the deeds of the body, you liue.</hi> Alſo, 1. Corinth. 6.19. <hi>Know you not that your body is the Temple of the holy ghost, which is in you, the which you haue of God, and are not your owne? for you were bought with a price: then glorifie God in your body and in your ſpirit, for they are Gods.</hi> It is commanded to all the faithfull carefully to keepe and entertaine Faith. S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſheweth the neceſſity thereof, ſaying, 1. Tim. 1.18.19. <hi>Fight a good fight, hauing faith and a good conſcience, which ſome haue put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and as concerning faith haue made ſhipwracke.</hi> And in the 5. chap. ver. 8. <hi>If there be any that prouideth not for his own, and namely for them of his houſhold, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth the faith, and is worſe then an infidell.</hi> The neceſſity of repentance is confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

As for the neceſſity to auoyd his chaſtiſements, <hi>Dauid</hi> giueth vs warning jnough ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, when hee ſayth, <hi>God chaſtiſeth the ſonnes of men, becauſe of their iniquities,</hi> Pſal. 89.33. The ſecond cauſe named Dignity, <note place="margin">The digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of them</note> conſiſteth in this poynt, that the belieuers are the children of God, temples of the holy Ghoſt, pallaices wherein Chriſt dwelleth, whoſe mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and co-heires they are.
